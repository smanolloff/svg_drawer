# Heights and widths calculated experimentally with chrome inspector.
#
# y_offset is also calculated experimentally with chrome inspector:
# As opposed to HTML, in SVG when a text is rendered, all text is
# *transposed* down by (1.2 * [font_height]) px.
# This causes problems when rendering a text box with a border, as
# chars like 'g' or 'p' will intersect with the bottom border (and
# and '_' char will even be rendered entirely below the border)
# This is compensated with the y_offset, which seems to be ~0.22
# (how that value is used can be seen in #calculate_y_offset_px)
